IMPORTANT: if image_sizeX x image_sizeY < 169 then the program will work
incorrectly. Sad i don't even know why this is so.



using in cmd:

compiled_drawer.exe [image_size_x] [image_size_y]
	|
	v
creates a new image with the given size




compiled_drawer.exe [img_file_path]
	|
	v
loads image stored in a file (img_file_path)
